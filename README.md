# Stack 4.0

`Stack` 4.0  is a new attempt to mitigate a fundamental deficiency of
human brain, namely the inability to cope with deep and branched 
trees of tasks when solving a problem.

This software assists the brain by keeping a representation of a 
'stack trace'.

# Design

Previous two versions (2.0 implemented in Java, 3.0 in Scala, backed 
up by XML files) turned out to be too rigid and cumbersome, 
so in this version we
return to the design of the very first version, and admit that
directory structures already are the most efficient way to represent
nested subtasks. This software consists entirely of bash scripts.
