# Stack 4.0

This collection of bash scripts helps to keep track of multiple 
hierarchically organized subtasks.

# Usage
Simply `cd` into a directory with the tasks, then call `stack`. This will start a new
bash console with a bunch of stack-specific commands. 
There is detailed documentation and autocompletion support for each command. 
Type `help` to get some overview.
