### AVAILABLE COMMANDS
  help <cmd>          Shows help for specified command, or this text if no arguments are specified.
  add                 Adds a new subtask. Properties can be specified either interactively or as arguments.
  focus <subtask>     Focus on a subtask.
  concrete            Follow the focus-pointers to the most specific subtask.
  push                Adds and immediately focuses on subtask.
  todo                Shows progress and tells what is todo for this task.
  finish <subtask>    Marks subtask as finished. Marks this task as finished if no subtask is specified.  
  abandon <substask>  Marks subtask as abandoned. Marks this task as abandoned if no subtask is specified.

### EXAMPLES

For example, if you want to get extra information about adding new subtasks, 
you could do the following:

user@host> help add

Here is another example that shows usage of the arguments. 
Suppose you want to push a new subtask on the stack. 
First, take a look at the list of available options by typing:

user@host> help push

Now push a new subtask on the stack using the arguments:

user@host> push --value 3.14 --description "Eat a pie" "Pi"


### STRUCTURE

Every subtask is represented by a separate directory that contains a file 
with key-value pairs, as well as a plain text file with a description.
Subtasks are represented as subdirectories.

It is possible to simply delete the subtask directories with 'rm' command, 
or move them around as seems fit.

The description files should be edited with a text editor of your choice.

The key-value files can also be modified manually if you want to change some 
of the properties of the subtask (e.g. the relative task value), 
but make sure that these files remain valid.

Finished or abandoned tasks are moved to hidden directories, 
they can be reactivated by changing the name of directory.
