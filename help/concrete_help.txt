The `concrete` command attempts to follow the focus-pointers down 
the task hierarchy tree, until it finds the most concrete subtask. 

Arriving at the most concrete subtask, it prints the todos for this subtask.

The syntax is:

>> concrete

The idea is that one can use the focus-pointers for jumping from a general
super-task to a very concrete little subtask.
