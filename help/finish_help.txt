The `finish` command can be used to mark a subtask as finished.

The syntax is:

>> finish <subtaskName>

The subtask is then marked as 100% complete, the corresponding directory is
moved to a hidden directory named `.finished.subtaskName`.

This command can also be used without any arguments.
If one types just:

>> finish

then the current task is marked as finished.

Finished tasks can be reactivated using the `reactivate` command.
