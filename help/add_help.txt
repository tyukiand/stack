The `add` command is used to create new subtasks.

A subtask is represented by a directory that contains hidden text files
`.task-properties.kv` and `.description.txt`.

The `.description.txt` file can be edited manually later, it stores the
description. 
The first line of this file is used in stack traces and todo-lists.

The `.task-properties.kv` can also be adjusted manually, albeit carefully.

### Interactive mode ##################

The `add` command can be used in interactive mode, for example

>> add

starts a dialog where the user can specify the name
of new subtask, it's relative value, and a short
description. 


### Arguments #########################

The `add` command can also be run with arguments.
The syntax is as follows:

>> add --description "My description" --value 0.25 mySubtaskName

It can be written shorter as follows:

>> add -d "My description" -v 0.25 mySubtaskName

Notice that the subtask name can consist only of
symbols 'a'-'z', 'A'-'Z', '0'-'9' and the underscore '_'.

Almost all arguments can be omitted.
If the `-d` option is omitted, then the 
description is set to empty string. 
The description can later be modified manually by editing
the hidden `.description.txt` file in the directory that
corresponds to the task.

If the `-v` option is omitted, then the relative value 
is set to 1.0.

### Examples ##########################

Add a new task called "myNewTask" without description and with value 1.0:

>> add myNewTask 

Add a new task called "Pi" with description "Eat a pie" and value 3.14:

>> add --description "Eat a pie" --value 3.14 Pi

Same as above, but using shorter syntax:

>> add -d "Eat a pie" -v 3.14 Pi
