The `abandon` command can be used to mark a subtask as
abandoned.

The syntax is:

>> abandon <subtaskName>

The subtask is then no longer relevant for overall progress computation.
The corresponding directory is moved to a hidden directory named `.abandoned.subtaskName`.

This command can also be used without any arguments.
If one types just:

>> abandon

then the current task is marked as abandoned.

Abandoned tasks can be reactivated using the `reactivate` command.
