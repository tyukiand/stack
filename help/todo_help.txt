The `todo` command displays progress information about the current task.

It displays the task name and overall progress.

Then it shows the stack trace: a kind of bread-crumb that shows why we
are doing this task. The more general predecessor tasks are further down in
the list.

In the subtasks-section it shows a list of subtasks, together with their
progress and short description. The focused subtask is marked by an arrow.

Finally, the `todo` command displays the full description of the current task.
The description is stored in the hidden file `.description.txt`,
and can be edited by any text editor.
