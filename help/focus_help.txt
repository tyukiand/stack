The `focus` command is used to focus on a subtask.

It sets the focus-pointer of the current task on the selected subtask.

The syntax is:

>> focus <nameOfTheFocusedSubtask>

The parameter should be plain name of an existing 
subtask (child directory), longer paths are not 
supported. Trailing "/" is ignored.

If no argument is specified, that is, if one just calls:

>> focus

then it is equivalent to changing to the parent task,
then focusing on the current task,
then changing back to the current task.

Focused subtasks are marked by an arrow `->` in the todo-list.

To follow the focus-pointers down the task hierarchy, use `concrete` command.
To unset the focus-pointer of the current task, use the `blur` command.
